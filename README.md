#JABS: Just another Bootstrap "Swag"

##Work on it

Download the devDependencies using npm and work on the directory `app`. Make sure to check out `app/bower_components/sass-bootstrap/lib/_variables.scss` to change the colors.

Use the command `grunt server` on your commandline to show your changes. Livereload included.

##Distribute it

Run `grunt build` and have fun with the output of the `dist` directory. This requires running OS X or Linux.
